## Input/Output: Working with Files and JSON in Python

This section covers handling file operations and working with JSON data in Python, which are crucial for reading from and writing to files, as well as exchanging data in the widely-used JSON format.

### Key Topics:

- **Working with Files**: Read from and write to text and binary files using Python’s built-in file handling methods. This includes opening, closing, and manipulating file contents.
  - Example operations: `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`.
  
- **Reading and Writing JSON**: Read JSON data from files and write Python objects as JSON to files. Use Python’s `json` module for loading and dumping JSON.
  - Example operations: `json.load()`, `json.dump()`, `json.loads()`, `json.dumps()`.
  
- **JSON Serialization and Deserialization**: Convert Python objects into JSON format (serialization) and convert JSON data back into Python objects (deserialization). Handle custom Python objects.
